	<p>It is a term used to describe the period where the sperm fertilizes the egg which develops the growth of a fetus inside a woman's womb or uterus.
The duration of growth of the fetus lies upto 40 weeks or 9 months that is measured by the woman's last menstrual cycle to the date when the baby is born. It consists of three stages, namely trimesters.</p>
<li>How to check if I am pregnant?</li>
<p>The first sign of noticing is when you start missing your periods if a week or more has passed and your cycle hasn't started then there is a possibility that you might be pregnant.</p>
<p>The sore or swollen breasts can be another factor to notice the changes.
If you are suffering from morning sickness, constant fatigue, or if you are urinating more than usual, then these are your signs to take either a pregnancy test at home and check out your doubts. </p>
<p>Or else you can also consult a doctor, even if the tests turn out positive, a visit to the doctor is very necessary as test kits can turn out false too.</p>
<li>How can you take care of yourself and the baby during pregnancy?</li>
<p>1. Don't forget to take your necessary 3 meals a day including with at least 2 healthy snacks every day.</p>
<p>2. Drink plenty of fluids in the shape of water, fruit juices, or any other healthy beverages that match your diet's composition.</p>
<p>3. Eat fish that has a low level of mercury.</p>
<p>4. Always go for the foods that consist of important vitamins for you and your baby, and do keep in mind to ask for a diet chart from your doctor.</p>
<p>5. Keep in track of the mood swings, and do what feels do but within limits.
Go on for a walk and do yoga as the exercise is very necessary. But don't do rigorous activities that will affect your baby.</p>
