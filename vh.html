		<p>Proper vaginal hygiene is extremely important for a woman’s health. Whether or not you’re of reproductive age, keeping the vulva clean the correct way can make a huge difference when it comes to vaginal infections. Your vagina is a sensitive area and, thankfully, maintaining good hygiene is incredibly simple.

        The most important part about vaginal hygiene is maintaining its pH. A normal vaginal pH tends to be slightly acidic and  when this is thrown off, women start to experience symptoms of infections. These symptoms might include irritation, itchiness and pain. Some women are more sensitive to vaginal changes, particularly during pregnancy.

       The pH can be altered by any foreign substance that’s introduced into your vagina – so think twice about what enters your vagina to avoid disrupting its protective environment. At the same time, don’t strictly focus on the vagina itself but also the surrounding external area. Here are several tips to maintain proper vaginal hygiene.</p>
       <p style="font-family: Arial; color: red;">Washing</p>
       <ul><li>Wash the area with warm water daily, even if you skip a shower.</li>
   <li>Avoid using scented soaps and gels. The scents can irritate the area and will only serve as a mask to cover up an actual issue that might be causing odor.</li>
   <li>Even if you’re experiencing vaginal odor and other problems, douching will only cover up the problem and possibly make it worse – not fix it.</li>
  <li> After using the toilet, wipe front to back. Even better, rinse with warm water to remove unwanted bacteria and pat dry.</li>
   <li>Don’t shave the entire pubic area, which can cause irritation. Cuts and nicks can also introduce unwanted bacteria. The hair exists to protect the region, so trim back if necessary with scissors, not a razor. Do not use hair removal cream, which burns off hair and can be especially harsh on the skin.</li></ul>
   <p style="font-family: Arial; color: red">Clothing</p>
   <ul><li>Avoid tight-fitting pants that restrict air circulation in the vaginal area.</li>
 <li>Wear cotton underwear over synthetic fabric. Cotton is better at absorbing moisture.</li>
  <li> Change your clothes and underwear after the gym.</li>
  <li> Don’t wear a thong while exercising. The constant movement will introduce anal bacteria into the vagina and cause infections.</li>
  <li> Avoid wearing a wet swimsuit all day.</li>
  <li>Change your underwear twice a day if you have extra discharge to avoid sitting in damp underwear.</li></ul>
