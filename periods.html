 			<li>I think I had my first period, how can I be sure?</li>
 			<p>First things, first. Don't panic if other people of your age that are in puberty(12-15) have started getting their first periods.
      But if you are stressed about it, consult your doctor.
     Some clear signs for girls around this age are bloating, pimples, sore breasts, cramps in the abdomen area. These are the clear signs before you spot brownish blood staining your panties, though a lot of them expect it to be crimson, the color is brownish because of the impurities combined with the blood.</p>
     <p>Your first period might be of low flow, less duration says 2-3 days. But it's normal because your body starts to get used to it. The first year of your menstrual cycle might be a bit unusual but as you mature you will get a hang of the pattern and the symptoms.</p>
     <li>Vaginal Discharge: What's Normal What's Not?</li>
     <p>Vaginal Discharge is fluid that comes out of your vagina.
      What's normal is that normal vaginal discharge is thin, sticky, and elastic. It looks thin and gooey. Some females use panty liners to keep their underwear dry, and it's normal to have a lot of vaginal discharge as well as it's normal if you have no discharge at all. Vaginal fluids are white, clear, or off-white.</p>
      <p>What's not normal is when there's a change in odor, especially unpleasant odor, a change in color if it turns out greenish or anything relatively looking like pus. Vaginal itching, swelling, change in texture, vaginal bleeding other than the menstrual period are possible ways to spot an abnormal discharge. If you counter such a problem, consult your doctor right away.</p>
      <li>Can a girl get pregnant if she never had her period?</li>
      <p>Yes, a female can get pregnant even before her first period.
      The process of getting pregnant is related to ovulation. As a girl can ovulate before her period starts, it's possible to get pregnant if she has unprotected intercourse or if the protection fails.</p>
      <li>What should we do when we feel pain during periods?</li>
      <p>Period pains also called menstrual cramps can be pretty painful because the chemicals your uterus makes, make the muscles of your uterus tighten to push out the blood from your vagina. So to tackle these, you can use a heating pad, hot water bottle on your lower abdomen as heat helps them relax easily. You can also indulge yourself in doing some light and easy exercises to comfort your muscles or relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation.</p>
      <p>Though pain relief medicines work the best and fast, try avoiding them if the home remedies can help you tackle the them</p>
      <li>What should I do when I have PMS?</li>
      <p>PMS sometimes makes people emotional and get cramps before or after one's periods.
       So when one encounters it, then one can do various things like taking pain medicines(Advil, or Tylenol) but do it after consulting your doctor and keep the use of it to a minimum.</p>
     <p>One can also do easy and light exercises to help relax the tightened muscles of the uterus.
      Using a heating pad or using a hot water bottle in your belly and lower abdomen helps to a lot of extent in reducing the horrible pain, you can take a hot bath, or if needed have an orgasm, you can take certain vitamins and herbs like vitamin B1, fish oil, fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, and zinc sulfate as they help tackle the pain.</p>
      <li>What problems can Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) cause?</li>
      <p>PCOS is a condition that affects a woman's hormone levels. Women with PCOS produce a higher level of the male hormone than needed or that is normal.</p>
      <p>The hormonal imbalance caused due to PCOS makes it hard to get pregnant or their bodies sometimes can skip menstrual periods. As the male hormone content increases, one can face hair growth on the body and face. It also contributes to long term problems like diabetes and heart disease. Birth control pills and diabetes drugs can help fix the hormonal imbalance but consultation with a Doctor is strictly necessary. It's mostly considered genetic but any solid proof is yet to be found.</p>
      <li>Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB)</li>
      <p>You might not know the term, but you surely have encountered it.
       So AUB is basically bleeding from the uterus with a duration longer than usual or which occurs at irregular times</p>
       <p>The bleeding may be heavier or lighter than usual, as it varies from individual to individual. It can occur randomly or often.</p>
       <p>It might occur after sex, or as spotting or bleeding during your periods which lasts longer than normal, with heavy flow of blood. The main cause of it is hormonal imbalance that a body goes through during menstruation, other causes might include cancer of ovaries, uterus or vagina, excess clotting, thickening of the walls of uterus, PCOS, weight gain or loss, or many more.
       But the bleeding during pregnancy is not a cause of AUB, it is totally different.
