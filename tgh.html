			<p>The skin of teenagers might get oilier as they attain puberty. Oily skin traps dust and dirt and thus serves as a breeding ground for germs. It leads to the development of several skin issues, such as acne and blackheads. Therefore, it is good for a teen to develop a proper skincare routine by regularly washing their face with mild soap or facial cleanser and water.</p>
			<p>You want to keep down the shine without being harsh on your skin. According to Wu, there's a basic three-step process to oil control: (1) choose a salicylic acid cleanser, (2) use an oil-free primer to control shine, and (3) blot oil during the day using specialized cloths or tissues.</p>
			<p> Even if your best friend can sleep with her makeup on and look great, it's not a great idea. "If you're simply too exhausted to tie your hair back, take off makeup, and wash your face, at least use a pre-moistened cleansing wipe to take off makeup, dirt, and oil," Wu says. If you make a regular habit of sleeping in makeup, you can have an acne breakout or develop a bumpy rash called perioral or periocular dermatitis.</p>

			<p> Teenagers go out more often than children. This way, their hair (as well as skin) tends to become dirty. Also, hormonal changes might make the hair oily and smelly. The thickness of the hair only compounds the problem. Therefore, encourage your teen to wash their hair with a mild shampoo twice or thrice a week.Before that, we bring to you simple remedies to wash away the woes at home</p>
            <ul>
			<li> Apply lukewarm hair oil on scalp and hair strands</li>
			<li> Avoid using dryers, straighteners and curlers </li>
			<li> Condition naturally at home with egg masks</li>

			<p> Teenage is the time when they like to grow their nails, style them into different shapes, and design them. However, fingernails are an ideal breeding ground for germs. These germs can transfer into the mouth while eating with hands. Touching the face can also cause the germs to get into the mouth, eyes, and nose, or on the skin. Thus, it is necessary for your teen to maintain nail hygiene. </p>
			<p>They can scrub the dirt out using a nail brush. Besides, a weekly clipping should help get rid of dirt and reduce the possibility of painful ingrown nails.</p>

			<p>Poor oral hygiene can lead to problems such as bad breath and tooth decay. Make your child brush and floss their teeth twice a day. They should also wash their mouth after meals, either with plain water or with a mouthwash.</p>
			<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are some tips/techniques on proper brushing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle against your gum line. Gently brush from where the tooth and gum meet to the chewing surface in short (about half-a-tooth-wide) strokes. Brushing too hard can cause receding gums, tooth sensitivity, and, over time, loose teeth.</li>
				<li>Use the same method to brush all outside and inside surfaces of your teeth.</li>
				<li>To clean the chewing surfaces of your teeth, use short sweeping strokes, tipping the bristles into the pits and crevices.</li>
				<li>To clean the inside surfaces of your top and bottom front teeth and gums, hold the brush almost vertical. With back and forth motions, bring the front part of the brush over the teeth and gums.</li>
				<li>Using a forward-sweeping motion, gently brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth to remove the decay-causing bacteria that exist in these places.</li>
				<li>Play a favorite song while brushing your teeth to get used to brushing for a full 2 to 3 minutes. Some electronic toothbrushes have timers that let you know when 2 minutes are up</li>

			<img src="https://www.centura.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_image/public/2020-04/handwashing.jpg">
			<p>Hands can spread germs to almost any part of the body. It is necessary to wash hands before and after meals, after playing outdoors, after feeding or playing with pets, after using the toilet and after any other situation where they touch a contaminated surface.</p>
			<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> Here's why handwashing is effective:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Washing hands prevents illnesses and spread of infections to others</li>
				<li>Cleaning hands with soap and water removes germs from multiple sources</li>
				<li>Handwashing helps battle the rise in antibiotic resistance</li>

			<div class="bo"><li>Bathing</li>
			<img src="https://images.herzindagi.info/image/2021/May/bathing-essentials-for-glow-main.jpg" style="height: 15%">
			<p>Body odor develops due to the development of a new type of sweat gland during adolescence, in the armpits and genital areas. The bacteria present on the skin feed on the compounds present in the sweat from these regions and cause body odor.</p>
			<p>Therefore, you need to explain to your teen that bathing, especially after physical activity, helps remove sweat and bacteria and prevents body odor. They may also use an antiperspirant to control sweat production.</p>
			<p>What is the importance of bathing? A bath is able to open up your pores, which helps get rid of the dirt and other toxins that are trapped inside, giving you a fresher and cleaner skin. You'd better take a shower first to get rid of the dirt on the surface of your skin before taking a bath.</p>

			<li>Menstrual hygiene</li>
			<p>Teaching menstrual hygiene to a teenage girl involves guiding them to track their periods, use hygiene products such as a sanitary pad (reusable or disposable), or tampon, and their safe disposal after use. A teenage girl should also be given directions on the correct usage of these products, and their frequency of changing these products.</p></div>

			<<li>Shave safe</li>
			<p>Teen girls, who want to remove their underarm hair, need to be told about the importance of using sterilized equipment and to be careful while shaving their genital area, and to avoid removing this unless absolutely necessary. Also, teach them about after-shave skin care routine and why they should not be sharing their paraphernalia with others.</p>
			<P style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Shave Pubic Hair If You Have a Vagina</P>
			<ul><li>Trim Your Pubic Hair:
            Shaving your pubic area is easier when you've already trimmed off any excess hair. Grab a pair of small scissors or a hair trimmer and cut your pubic hair so it's only a few centimeters long.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate the Skin:
            Use a loofah, washcloth, or exfoliating sponge to gently exfoliate your skin before shaving. Exfoliating will remove any dead skin and allow you to shave the hair as near to the root as possible. Harsh exfoliants aren't necessary and can actually do more harm than good in your pubic area. </li>
            <li>Apply Shaving Cream:
Apply a generous amount of shaving cream to the areas you want to shave. It's best to use fragrance-free shaving cream on the area, as creams with fragrance can irritate the delicate skin.</li>
<li>Shave in the Direction of Hair Growth:
Pull the skin taut and shave in the direction of your hair growth to avoid irritating the hair follicle.</li>
        </ul>
