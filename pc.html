 	<p>Once you get home from the hospital you'll be focused on caring for your new baby. Yet you can't forget about another important person. You!

    Your body will still have to recover from nine months of carrying around and nurturing a growing baby  not to mention the delivery. Make sure to look after yourself in the postpartum weeks, so you can recover more quickly and have enough energy to care for your baby.</p></div>

    	<li><mark> Get plenty of rest.</mark> Get as much sleep as possible to cope with tiredness and fatigue. Your baby may wake up every two to three hours for feeding. To make sure you’re getting enough rest, sleep when your baby sleeps.</li>
    	<li><mark> Seek help.</mark>  Don’t hesitate to accept help from family and friends during the postpartum period, as well as after this period. Your body needs to heal, and practical help around the home can help you get much-needed rest. Friends or family can prepare meals, run errands, or help care for other children in the home.</li>
    	<li><mark> Eat healthy meals.</mark> Maintain a healthy diet to promote healing. Increase your intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and protein. You should also increase your fluid intake, especially if you are breast-feeding.</li>
    	<li><mark> Exercise.</mark> Your doctor will let you know when it’s OK to exercise. The activity should not be strenuous. Try taking a walk near your house. The change of scenery is refreshing and can increase your energy level.</li>
