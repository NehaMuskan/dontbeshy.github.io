          <h2>How to use :</h2>
          <img src="https://www.talisi.us/image/catalog/2020%20Design/Folding/FM-C-Fold.jpg" class="use"><p>
          There are many different folding methods so experiment and find the one that works for you. 
          Two of the most popular are: The C-Fold. 
          When you’re inserting your menstrual cup, you need to keep it folded until it is inside of your vagina.
          </p>
          <p>It’s important to relax your muscles when inserting your menstrual cup, so find a comfortable position.
            You can lie down, squat, sit on the toilet or simply stand up. You’ll find the position that works best for you over time.
            You might want to use water or a water-based lubricant to make insertion easier. </p>
            <p>Insert the folded menstrual cup and once the entire cup is inside of you, remove your fingers and let it open up.
            If the menstrual cup has been inserted correctly, you might hear a “pop” or a suction sound which means that the cup has unfolded and created the necessary suction seal.
           If you’re in doubt, reach in and feel around the base of the cup – it should feel round or oval and not have any noticeable folds.</p>

           <li>Tampon</li>
           <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/8/c685f766-9ace-44f3-87d3-c9e7e61acb9a-fotolia_128622365_subscription_monthly_m.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress" class="peeimg">
           <p>A tampon is a menstrual product that absorbs blood and other vaginal discharge by inserting it into the vagina during menstruation. These are different from pads as they have to be inserted inside to absorb the blood in order to stop staining. Once you have inserted the tampon correctly, it starts expanding as soon as blood comes into contact with the fabric. The fabric is a combination of cotton and rayon and is instructed to discard after 4 to 8 hours of usage. Reuse of these products is neither healthy nor it is advisable</p>
           <h2>How to use :</h2>
           <p>Wash your hands and get into a comfortable position. You can squat, put one leg up, or sit on the toilet with your knees apart.</p>
           <p>Push the tampon into your vagina using the applicator or your finger, depending on what kind of tampon you have.</p>
           <p>Inserting a tampon in your vagina is more comfortable if you’re relaxed. Using tampons with smooth, rounded applicators may make it easier. You can also put a little bit of lubricant on the tip of the tampon or applicator. If you’re having trouble, ask someone you trust (like your mom, sister, or another person you trust who has used tampons) to show you how to put the tampon into your vagina.</p>
           <p>It’s best to change your tampon every 4-8 hours. Don’t leave your tampon in for more than 8 hours. You can wear a tampon overnight, but put it in right before bed and change it as soon as you get up in the morning.</p>
           <p>Tampons have a string at one end that hangs out of your vagina. You take the tampon out by gently pulling the string. It’s easier to take your tampon out when it’s wet from absorbing the max amount of period flow it can.</p>
           <P>Wrap used tampons in toilet paper and throw them away in the trash don’t flush them.</P>
